## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The only challenges I faced when building the app was getting my own functionalities to work. For example, the search bar, if the user enters nothing nothing should happen, but it shows the filtered games. Eventually I 
found a solution which is creating a statement where if the user enters nothing in the search bar all games will show. The reason behind this function is because if the searchbar was used, and if the user wants to see all games again
they would have to use the filterd "show all games" button, but now the user can enter nothing and it will show all games as well.
